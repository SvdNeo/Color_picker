creating circle on images by creating 10 divs which are relative to images
making those circles hide/display based on selection
making it draggable
when add btn is clicked  1st circle is selected and it is made draggable
circle needs to be converted to color picker(eyedropper) which picks color from the drop position
color picked should be updated in the palette
